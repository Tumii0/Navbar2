Thats a lie i don't really like fried fi
 so if i want to change directory ill do 
cd folder name
to make a new folder/directory ill do
mkdir folder/directory name 
to make a new file in my folder ill use
touch file name
to open the file ill do 
start and file name
to open the git interface to start commiting ill do 
git init 
to add the file to the staging area so it can be tracked 
ill do git add then file name 
or git add . to add all files 
then next ill needed to commit
ill do git commit -m(the message i want to put in the comit)
to check if its successfully commited ill do git status
to check the details of the file ill do
git log.
